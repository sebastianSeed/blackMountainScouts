QUESTIONS FOR OTHERS OR BUSINESS:
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SHOULD ALL USER FIELDS FOR KID BE MANDATORY?

SHOULD EVENTS AND NEWS LETTERS BE PUBLIC?


BUILT BUT NEED CONFIRM


Should all kids have a logon account?
Should kids get emails for events and newsletters?


=========================================================================
IDEAS TO ADD MAYBE AFTER EVERYTHING ELSE IS DONE
    -- Unsubscribe in emails we send out for events and newsletter? Could just send a link with unique id 
       of some type - if they click it then set a flag on their record to not email them
          (Don't need that option on member updates)
      Flag field in db would be hidden from admin ? Or displayed
      
    -- Reporting - can get add on to try https://www.djangopackages.com/packages/p/django-model-report/
    looks like you define your own reports though -- demos
