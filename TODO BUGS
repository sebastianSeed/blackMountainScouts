HIDE ALL THE NON NEEDED MODELS IN ADMIN USING TEMPLATE OR UNREGISTER


1) Setup amazon s3

Rationale: 
Heroku is now running ok with static files (uploading them
to heroku git repository after running collect static here)
- problem was that heroku was not getting the static
folders for apps which are part of library eg forum
--- when you run collect static it pulled them to a spot
heroku can see and use
BUT
heroku loses all data every restart so if any data
is added via website eg uploaded pictures etc
it will be lost the second heroku goes down for some reason
or you need to push out a change
