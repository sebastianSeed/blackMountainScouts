Developing for django and heroku tips



1) First follow doco on heroku to get setup as collaborator
and also the getting started with django

2) Install git and push to heroku to update code on heroku
-- Push to https://github.com/sebastianSeed/blackMountainScouts
when you have stable ready code you want to backup / commit

3) Heroku db does not auto update - so if you make 
schema changes (likely) then you need to run 

heroku pg:reset postgres --confirm blackmountainscouts
heroku run python manage.py syncdb
